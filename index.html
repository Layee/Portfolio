      	 	 <p>Hello there and thank you for checking my website out. My name is Abraham Swaray and I am <span class="novice">novice programmer</span>. I am currently learning to become a full stack web developer at <span class="treehouse">TreeHouse</span>. This is what I have learned so far at TreeHouse and reading books. This website is based on pure CSS3 at this point of building it. I am very proud of what I have achieved within the past couple of months at TreeHouse. I have learned the basic of building a website using html,css,and some JavaScript to enhance my website performance. I am currently located in New York City. If you're interesting in working with me or want me to be part of your team,please dont't hesitate to contact me. I love JavaScript and  I think is the best programming language in the world. My goal is to become a beast at it.<span class="mile" >" A journey of a thousand miles begins with single step"</span> and I have started that journey to become a web developer.I know I have long way to reach my full potential,but I will surely get there some day with hard work. If I am not coding, you can catch me reading programming books or playing my favorite online games</p>
